White Paper of Tulsa code: TLA
Created in 2020, September.

the Genius of Pro Token, the Tulsa Token Wrapped from ETH-BLOCK

*Abstract
Tulsa has been perfectly deploy under ETH-BLOCK, after researching, re-build from the Prototype that combined the first pro token from Gen.2 to ETH-2 Mechanism, Tulsa are the token format that use the =TVL, from valued assets that build from other project, the cases is to use for Lock & Unlock the value, and the cases to use to run this protocol asset are the standard Contract that has been deployed earlier in Chainlink Token. To do the math and gain to help the Economic of Cryptographics, tulsa are using the technology of Decentralized Locked Guarantee or known as Liquidity, so the participant can build their own economic program for case like borrowing and gain the reward by staking other assets to TLA asset, so after participant use TLA to lock their other asset in Decentralized Pro TLA, the Security has been upgraded into 100% secure to Lock their asset, and afterward they can unlock their other asset with more value.

*Absurdly
Since the Code are the open-source, there will be no more hidden technic that anyone can re-change, re-build with this Contract. (Means even the- team that build this project CAN NOT change the protocol) it is the Global Open-Source Contract token. Anyone can build with their own profile program, add the API and other tools out of the Contract of Tulsa (TLA) Token.

Mechanism.
Locker -> Locker (Re-Gain the value by borrowing from the previous Locker)
Next Gen. Lock & Unlock until 100% Gen Asset open, (when the Supplied Spread and the TVL are full of stack, everyone hodl the TLA token, and 1 to 80% participant sure will re-build take and re-take the gain Value, so it will start from the began Genesis) - the Puzzle Trade, it will continuely re-generate.

CASES Re-Build Tax
5% of the total Lock will converted into Chain fee's =and will deploy to liquidity provider for fullfill the Genesis guarantee.
Tax hold will be spread for next unlockers.

re-Address list *for unlock TLA converter {cWBTC, cUNI - different type of format}
wBTC, wETH, ETH, UNI, YFI - TLA : {0x1dDB034C67E7e5313758c6F4341bE3e2F2d1b010} !the only address of Lock & Unlock
BNB - TLA : {bnb1yhkjcq99kycwrc86vpsrwxkd0jujhe3ut8zrnr + participant memo of erc20-wallet address} !the only address of Lock & Unlock
-* will be automatically cut the 5% for liquidity provider.

yf swap, called sentence:
*_callSwap = async (sendAsset, account, amount, callback) => {
    const web3 = new Web3(store.getStore('web3context').library.provider);

    var amountToSend = web3.utils.toWei(amount, "ether")
    if (sendAsset.decimals !== 18) {
      amountToSend = amount*10**sendAsset.decimals;
    }

    let call = ''

    switch (sendAsset.id) {
      case 'crvV1':
        call = 'swapv1tov3'
        break;
      case 'crvV2':
        call = 'swapv2tov3'
        break;
      case 'crvV3':
        call = 'swapv3tov4'
        break;
      default:
    }
    
Finance Load
*the finance load in tulsa TLA are the progress to increase the finance gain exploid by hodl the TLA/STAKE, by having for max 100,000 TLA for trade, means it can get limited time to spend the supplied, TLA are the extend format of token by using only 100,000 TLA to be re-undo and re-using.

ERC20
*the ERC20 token TLA standardizes convert asset to the ERC20 format.
*easy access with high PRO protocol, it defind to be the biggest data asset for trust.

Trust issues
*the TLA are the open-source to be the very Transparency cryptocurrency in internet Digital world-wide.

Supply Allocation (Shares) - Transparency

(82,000 TLA - Total LOCK/UNLOCK)
(10,000 TLA - Locked Value)
(5,000 TLA - Locked for Assets)
(1,500 TLA - Developing Project)
(1,500 TLA - Developer Privacy)

*Max Total Supply: 100,000 TLA.
    
*DeFi SDK
This first version of DeFi SDK is for read-only accounting purposes. Our next step is to introduce Interactive Adapters that allow users to make cross-protocol transactions from a single interface. We are incredibly excited to work with developers, users and the wider DeFi community to make these integrations as secure and accessible as possible. Watch this space, because the “De” in DeFi is about to get a whole lot more user-friendly!

Like Bitcoin, these services don't require anyone's permission to use, and can be accessed around the world. Trading and lending arrangements are overseen by so-called smart contracts, which serve to enforce whatever deal—perhaps a 6 month loan at 5% interest—two parties have struck on the platform.

*goods TLA with over ETH2 similarity 
Purchasing goods remotely currently requires multiple parties that need to trust each other. The simplest configuration involves a seller and a buyer. The buyer would like to receive an item from the seller and the seller would like to get money (or an equivalent) in return. The problematic part is the shipment here: There is no way to determine for sure that the item arrived at the buyer.
There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but all fall short in one or the other way. In the following example, both parties have to put twice the value of the item into the contract as escrow. As soon as this happened, the money will stay locked inside the contract until the buyer confirms that they received the item. After that, the buyer is returned the value (half of their deposit) and the seller gets three times the value (their deposit plus the value). The idea behind this is that both parties have an incentive to resolve the situation or otherwise their money is locked forever.

This contract of course does not solve the problem, but gives an overview of how you can use state machine-like constructs inside a contract.

this White paper are mean to be Transparent from under Project to the system project, with Beta to Main-Net, simple and usable to do on this project, the PRO, Gen contract, with the standard pro method from Solidity to other code that able to work with this open-source project.
